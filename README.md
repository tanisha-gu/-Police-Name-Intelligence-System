#  Police Name Intelligence System

A React-based forensic name matching tool designed for Indian law enforcement, enabling accurate identification of individuals across **Hindi (Devanagari)** and **English** scripts using multiple fuzzy matching algorithms and AI-powered analysis.

---

##  Overview

Police records in India often contain names spelled inconsistently due to transliteration differences, regional dialects, or data entry errors (e.g., *"Suresh"* vs *"Sursh"* vs *"Suresha"*). This system addresses that challenge by combining phonetic, edit-distance, and n-gram algorithms with real-time Hindi-to-English transliteration, enabling reliable name lookups across script variations.

---

##  Features

- **Multi-Algorithm Fuzzy Matching** — Combines five algorithms for robust name similarity scoring
- **Hindi ↔ English Transliteration** — Automatically converts Devanagari input to Roman phonetic form for cross-script search
- **AI Match Analysis** — Powered by Claude (Anthropic API) to explain why a name matched and recommend officer actions
- **Configurable Threshold** — Adjustable similarity threshold (default 45%) for broad investigation vs. precise verification
- **Role-Based Filtering** — Filter results by Suspect, Witness, Victim, or Reporter
- **Live Database Management** — Add new records with Hindi name, role, case ID, DOB, and address
- **Analytics Dashboard** — Visual comparison of algorithm performance and common Hindi name variation patterns
- **Operator Guidelines** — Built-in transliteration standards and search best practices for officers

##  Matching Algorithms

| Algorithm | Weight | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Jaro-Winkler** | 25% | Best for names with prefix variations (e.g., *Raj* vs *Rajesh*) |
| **Levenshtein Distance** | 20% | Handles typos and character-level edits |
| **Hindi Normalization** | 15% | Collapses phonetic equivalents (e.g., *aa→a*, *sh→s*) |
| **N-gram (Bigram)** | 15% | Substring similarity, effective for transliteration noise |
| **Soundex** | 15% | Groups phonetically similar names |
| **Metaphone** | 10% | Deep phonetic similarity for Indian consonant clusters |

The final score is a **weighted combination** of all six metrics. Scores ≥ threshold are returned as matches.

##  Hindi Transliteration

The system includes a custom Devanagari → Roman phonetic map covering:

- All Hindi vowels and consonants
- Aspirated consonants (`ख=kh`, `घ=gh`, `छ=chh`, `झ=jh`, `ठ=th`, `ढ=dh`, `फ=ph`, `भ=bh`)
- Special characters (`ड़=r`, `ज़=z`, `फ़=f`)
- Matras (vowel diacritics) and anusvara (`ं=n`)
- Conjunct consonants (`क्ष=ksh`, `त्र=tr`, `ज्ञ=gya`)

Queries typed in Devanagari are automatically transliterated before matching against the database.

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 16
- A React environment (Create React App, Vite, or similar)
- An [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/) for AI analysis

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/police-name-intelligence-system.git
cd police-name-intelligence-system
npm install
```

### API Key Setup

The AI Analysis feature calls the Anthropic API. Set up your key in your environment or proxy — the component uses:

```
https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages
```

> **Note:** Do not expose your API key in a client-side build for production. Route requests through a backend proxy.

### Run

```bash
npm start
```

## 📁 File Structure

```
police_name_matching.jsx   # Main self-contained React component
README.md
```

The entire application is a **single-file React component** with no external UI dependencies.

---

##  Data & Privacy

- The mock database (`RECORDS`) contains fictional test data for Delhi-based cases.
- No data is persisted between sessions; all records are stored in React state.
- AI analysis requests send only the name, match score, and match metadata — no PII beyond what the officer inputs.
- For production deployment, replace the in-memory database with a secure backend and authenticated API calls.
